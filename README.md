# Advent of Code 2022

_A language a day keeps the doctor away._

My goal for this year is to complete each day in a different programming language. I'm not playing for speed (apart from day 1, which failed miserably), but would like to keep on track where possible. 

**Why?** Why not?

| **Day** | **Language**   | **Thoughts**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|    1    | Python         | The plan: wake up at 4:50am, get a quick solution using the language I'm quickest in, top our private leaderboard in a blaze of glory. What really happened was spending about 5 minutes wondering why I was getting type errors; the reason? I'd named a variable `max`. *sigh*                           |
|    2    | Lua            | Lua is a strange little scripting langauge, although it's tables worked nicely for my lookup table based solution.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|    3    | Haskell        | Had to get some functional out the way before things got a bit more hairy. I'd definitely enjoy Haskell a lot more if I got to grips with it, but this took fustratingly long.                                                                                                                             |
|    4    | ARMv7 Assembly | Assembly can be really fun to write at times (especially when it involves doing compiler optimisations by hand). I don't fancy writing a [theme park simulation game](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/131q6b/til_roller_coaster_tycoon_was_programmed_by_one/) in it anytime soon however. |
|    5    | Dart | This was the first time (I think) I've come across any Dart code, and I found it really nice to work with- definitely a language I'm intending to come back to. |
